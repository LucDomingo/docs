# Device Node

The major number identifies the driver associated with the device. For example, /dev/null and /dev/zero are both managed by driver 1, whereas virtual consoles and serial terminals are managed by driver 4; similarly, both vcs1 and vcsa1 devices are managed by driver 7. The kernel uses the major number at open time to dispatch execution to the appropriate driver.

The minor number is used only by the driver specified by the major number; other parts of the kernel donâ€™t use it, and merely pass it along to the driver. It is common for a driver to control several devices (as shown in the listing); the minor number provides a way for the driver to differentiate among them.
